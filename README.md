# Portfolio-Images
Images of all of my favorite projects and apps.

I created this repository to showcase all of the things I have learned and built with Swift. 
My favorite online resources are Design+Code , Udemy , AppCoda. I owe everything I learned to them.
Im always learning something new since I am not currently working and seeking my first job as an iOS developer.

Before doing iOS development I did a little work as a Web developer, mostly Rails and Laravel. 
I had a hard time finding inspiration when doing web apps. I always dreamt of all my apps being mobile.

Shortly after my first PHP gig (contract work) I switched over to learn iOS development and never looked back. 
Since then this is what I have created.. Enjoy ðŸ˜„

<h2>UFC Fight Finder</h2>
- Pretty much the first serious app I start working on. I am huge UFC fan. <br>
- I got all this data thanks to @sungwoncho. It's funny because he also created the gem "has_friendship" that I used on some of my Rails projects.

<h2>Custom Table Views && Collection Views</h2>
- I love everything that iOS brings, especially it's attention to design.
